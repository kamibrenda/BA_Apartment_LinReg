# Project Title : Buenos-Aires-Price-Model

## Overview
Project modules:
1. Predicting prize with size
2. Predicting price with location

## Data Analysis

Visualize the relationship between apartment price and the various variables as per objectives of each project module.

## Model Development

Build a baseline model and train a Linear Regression model.

## Model Evaluation

Make predictions on the test set and evaluate model performance.

## Conclusion
Summary got from conclusions done from each project 
1. Predicting prize with size;
The visualisation below summarises that the price increases with subsequent increase in size of the apartments in the state of Capital Federal.
