# Project Title : Buenos-Aires-Price-Model

## Overview
Project modules:
1. Predicting prize with size
2. Predicting price with location 
3. Predicting price with neighbourhood
4. Predicting price with every other variable

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Dependancies and prerequisites required for the project are;
1. Jupyter lab 
2. Python 3.11 
3. Pandas library with the various modules depending on project module.

## Key project objectives

## 1. Data Wrangling

Load and wrangle the datasets to prepare it for analysis.

## Data Analysis

Visualize the relationship between apartment price and the various variables as per objectives of each project module.

## Model Development

Build a baseline model and train a Linear Regression model.

## Model Evaluation

Make predictions on the test set and evaluate model performance.

## Conclusion
Summary got from conclusions done from each project 
1. Predicting prize with size;
The visualisation below summarises that the price increases with subsequent increase in size of the apartments in the state of Capital Federal.

2. Predicting price with location
The visualisation below summarises that the price increases with based on the location of houses located on the coastline demonstrated with the various visualisations below.

3. Predicting price with neighbourhood;
The visualisation below summarises that more upper-class neighborhoods in this cases are predicted to have a more increase in price compared to working class neighborhoods.

4. Predicting price with every other variable- size, location and neighbourhood
The visualisation of this is demonstrated by use of an interactive dashboard that enables one to pick out either of the 15 neighbourhoods with the different latitudes and longitudes in relation to its location and the surface covered in metres squared as shown below.
